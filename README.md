Hey guys! 
Heads up before you do any changes, please make sure to pull from the master onto your own branch. Once you are done with your edits on your branch, go ahead and push them and create a pull request.

If you want to push your changes, request to push to the template. After the changes are reviewed, they will be pushed to master. 

Thank you guys so much for helping out btw!!!


Best, 
WIC Team :)
